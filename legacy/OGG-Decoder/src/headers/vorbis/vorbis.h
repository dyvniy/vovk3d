/*
Steps to decode (according to Vorbis I Spec)
- Decode packet type flag
- Decode mode number
- Decode window shape (long windows only)
- Decode floor
- Decode residue into residue vectors
- Inverse channel coupling of residue vectors
- Generate floor curve from decoded floor data
- Compute dot product of floor and residue, producing audio spectrum vector
- Inverse monolithic transform of audio spectrum vector, always an MDCT in Vorbis I
- Overlap/add left-hand output of transform with right-hand output of previous frame
- Store right-hand data from transform of current frame for further lapping
- If not the first frame, return results of overlap/add as audio result of current frame
